# Hi, I'm Jaime

GitHub is where I primarily store the research I conduct, as well as the resources that I create, to facilitate my work on non-internet-facing networks.

Currently working on:

* Evaluating message brokers / event-driven architecture: [message-brokers](https://github.com/JaimeStill/message-brokers)
* Transitioning from Windows to [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/)
* Learning Rust: [the-rust-programming-language](https://github.com/JaimeStill/the-rust-programming-language)
